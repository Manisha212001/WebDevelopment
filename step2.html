    <h1>VISIT TO A HILL STATION</h1>
<!--Heading 2-->
<h2>Short essay</h2>

<p><strong>“A thing of beauty is a joy forever!”</strong> I was always told that hills are a thing of beauty. I had a chance to visit Shimla with my family. We took a train this time and the journey was quite thrilling for us. Shimla being a beautiful hill station, it was a wonderful experience for us. The very famous Mall road was hustling and bustling with the crowd. Literally a meeting place for all in Shimla. The lower mall is full of life. One could see the entire Shimla hills from the ridge, the widest, and the most beautiful spot. The pretty church on the ridge is a bonus attraction for any tourist. Shimla is named after Goddess Shyamalais known as the <em>“queen of hills”</em>. </p><br>
